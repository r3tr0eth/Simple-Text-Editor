# Text Editor Project Documentation
## Introduction
This is a Python project that aims to build a basic text editor using the tkinter library. The project allows the user to create, open, edit, and save text files.

## Installation
To use this project, you'll need to install Python 3 and the tkinter library. You can download Python from the official website and tkinter should already be included with your Python installation.

## Usage
To run the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
python text_editor.py
``` 
This will launch the text editor window. To create a new file, click on the "New" button. To open an existing file, click on the "Open" button and select the file you want to open. To edit the file, simply type in the editor window. To save the file, click on the "Save" button.


## Features
1. New File Button

        The new file button allows the user to create a new text file.

2. Open File Button

        The open file button allows the user to open an existing text file.

3. Save File Button

        The save file button allows the user to save the edited text to a file.

4. Text Editing

        The user can edit the text in the editor window.

## Future Development
In the future, we plan to add more features to this text editor such as:

+ Syntax highlighting

+ Auto-indentation

+ Find and replace

## Conclusion
This text editor project provides a basic text editing experience using Python and the tkinter library. We hope to continue developing this project and adding more features in the future.
